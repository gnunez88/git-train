# Git Train

This project is suposed to help train the basics of git, even those ones we only can learn when
we work in a team.

To make it more comfortable, it works with SSH keys instead of credentials (user + password, or user + token
if you have 2FA enabled)

Unfortunately I was not able to make the fake users to use their own private key, which you should add to
your settings. They use your own private key, so make sure to create a private-public SSH-key pair just
for this.
